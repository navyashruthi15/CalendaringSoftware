# CalendaringSoftware
In todayâ€™s world most of us are dependent on the calendar for various purposes. We have decided to make your work more easier and efficient with our calendaring software. It is a software that minimally provides users with an electronic version of a calendar. This application will be built on the console without using graphic properties; instead, it utilizes many other window properties to give the application a colourful look and feel. Our software would enable the users to add notes , remainders and it enables the user to prepare a to-do list for a particular day with the time slots assigned. The software also enables the user to check for overlapping events etc features.
